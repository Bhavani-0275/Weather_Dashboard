This Weather App is a simple and responsive web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main purpose of this project is to display real-time weather information for any city entered by the user. The application uses the Open-Meteo API to fetch accurate and up-to-date weather data without requiring any API key.

The user can search for a city using the search box, and the app will display the current weather conditions, including temperature, weather description, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. Along with current weather, the application also shows a 24-hour hourly forecast and a 7-day daily forecast, making it easy for users to plan their day or week.

The interface is designed with a clean and modern look using CSS. A gradient sky-themed background, soft colors, and rounded cards provide a pleasant user experience. The app is fully responsive, meaning it works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices. Horizontal scrolling is used for the hourly forecast to maintain a neat layout on smaller screens.

Proper error handling is implemented in the application. If the user enters an invalid city name or leaves the search box empty, a clear and readable error message is displayed. Loading indicators are also used to improve user experience while fetching data from the API.

This project helped in understanding important web development concepts such as fetching data from APIs, using async and await, handling errors gracefully, and designing responsive layouts with CSS. It is a beginner-friendly project and serves as a strong foundation for learning front-end development and API integration.
